<h2 class="gap3"><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a><i>INTRODUCTION</i></h2>


<p>The present collection of "Representative Plays by American
Dramatists" is the first of its kind to be offered to the general
reader. In its scope, it covers a period from 1765-1911, and in its
plan of selection, it strives to show the advance in playwriting
during successive periods of American history.</p>

<p>Because of this scheme, the choice of plays for the Colonial and
Revolutionary sections necessarily includes several which, while
written for the stage, are not authentically located as far as production
is concerned. There is no indication that Robert Rogers's
"Ponteach" was ever accepted by any of the theatrical companies
of the time, and there is no positive proof that Mrs. Mercy
Warren's "The Group" was ever done, although there are casual
references to the fact that performances were given at Amboyne.
Nor have we any right to believe that Samuel Low's "The Politician
Out-witted" received other than scant treatment from the
managers to whom it was submitted; it was published rather to
please the readers of the closet drama. Nevertheless, it has been
thought essential to include these plays because they are representative
of the spirit of the times, and help to give a more comprehensive
view of the subjects which were treated in dramatic
form by the early American playwrights.</p>

<p>From the moment the American writer ceased to be an Englishman,
and became fully aware of his national consciousness,
American drama, following the trend of the development of
American literature, began to feel its way for the proper expression
of national characteristics.</p>

<p>And so, in the second and third volumes of this series, the
reader will find plays which, while not wonderful in their literary
value, are, nevertheless, very distinctive, as reflecting the theatrical
tastes of the time, and the very crude, but none the less sincere,
technical effort of the playwrights. All the dramas included
in the second and third volumes have had their stage productions,
and are thus representative of characteristics which mark the
abilities of certain actors, whose claims to originality are found in
the special types they created.</p>

<p>It has been the present editor's object so to arrange the successive
order of these plays that the reader may not only be able to
judge the change in stagecraft and technique, but, likewise, may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
note the change in social idea and in historical attitude toward
certain subjects. For example, "The Contrast" contains the first
American Stage Yankee&mdash;a model for a succession of Stage
Yankees to follow. But, whereas Royall Tyler's <i>Jonathan</i> was
not especially written to exploit the peculiar abilities of Mr.
Wignell, the comedian, most of the Yankee plays of a later date
were written to exploit the peculiar excellences of such actors as
G. H. Hill and James H. Hackett.</p>

<p>In no way can the reader better sense the change in social customs
and ideals than by reading a series of plays written in successive
generations and reflecting the varying customs of the
time. In some respects "The Contrast" may be considered our
very earliest drama of social manners, even though Royall Tyler
was not over-successful in stamping the small talk of his women
as being distinctively American. Rather is it the direct imitation&mdash;without
the brilliancy&mdash;of the small talk in "The School for
Scandal." But, nevertheless, "The Contrast" does attempt to
deal with society in New York before the nineteenth century, and
in Mrs. Mowatt's "Fashion," in Mrs. Bateman's "Self," in Bronson
Howard's "Saratoga" (which has been published), in Clyde
Fitch's "The Moth and the Flame," and in Langdon Mitchell's
"The New York Idea," we are given a very significant and
sharply defined panoramic view of the variations in moral and
social attitudes.</p>

<p>The plays included in this series have very largely been selected
because of their distinct American flavour. The majority of the
dramas deal directly with American subjects. But it seemed unwise
and unrepresentative to frame one's policy of selection too
rigidly on that score. Had such a method been adhered to, many
of the plays written for Edwin Forrest would have to be omitted
from consideration. It would have been difficult, because of this
stricture, to include representative examples of dramas by the
Philadelphia and Knickerbocker schools of playwrights. Robert
T. Conrad's "Jack Cade," John Howard Payne's "Brutus,"
George Henry Boker's "Francesca da Rimini," and Nathaniel P.
Willis's "Tortesa, the Usurer," would thus have been ruled from
the collection. Nevertheless are they representative plays by
American dramatists. Another departure from the American atmosphere
is in the case of Steele Mackaye; here in preference to
"Hazel Kirke," I have selected "Paul Kauvar," farthest away
from American life, inasmuch as it deals with Nihilism, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
written at a time when there was a Nihilistic fever in New York
City.</p>

<p>No editor, attempting such a comprehensive collection as this,
can be entirely successful in including everything which will enrich
his original plan. There are always limitations placed upon
him by the owners of copyrights, and by gaps in the development,
due to loss of manuscripts. It was naturally my desire to have all
the distinctive American playwrights represented in the present
collection. Therefore, in justice, the omissions have to be indicated
here, because they leave gaps in a development which it
would have been well to offer unbroken and complete.</p>

<p>When the collection was first conceived, there was every indication
that permission would be granted me to reproduce at least
one of the Robert Montgomery Bird manuscripts, now owned by
the University of Pennsylvania. Naturally, a collection of representative
plays should include either Bird's "The Gladiator," or
one of his other more or less oratorical and poetical pieces, written
under the inspiration of Edwin Forrest. The intention to include
John Augustus Stone's "Metamora" brought to light, after correspondence
with the Forrest Home in Philadelphia, that either the
manuscript of that play has irrevocably been destroyed, or else
has been preserved so carefully that no one remotely connected
with the actor Forrest has thus far been able to locate it.
Only a few well remembered speeches and isolated scenes are
seemingly left of a play which increased so largely the fame of
Mr. Forrest.</p>

<p>In the selection of <i>types</i> my attention naturally became centered
on the characters of <i>Colonel Mulberry Sellars</i>, and <i>Judge
Bardwell Slote</i>, the former in a dramatization of "The Gilded
Age," by Mark Twain and Charles Dudley Warner, and the latter,
in a play by Benjamin E. Woolf, called "The Mighty Dollar."
Extended investigation revealed the fact that, even if the plays
are not lost, they are still unlocated, by the literary executors of
Mark Twain on the one hand, and by the family of Mr. Woolf on
the other. It is well to mention these instances, because, until the
recent interest in the origins of American drama, manifest on all
sides, there has been a danger that many most valuable manuscript
plays would be lost to the student forever.</p>

<p>At a revival of individual scenes from distinctive American
Plays, given in New York, on January 22, 1917, considerable
difficulty was experienced before the stock-company manuscript<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
of Frank E. Murdoch's "Davy Crockett" was procured. This
play, old-fashioned in its general development, is none the less
representative of old-time melodramatic situation and romantic
manipulation, and there is every reason to believe that, with the
tremendous changes in theatrical taste, unless this play is published
in available printed form, it will be lost to the student of
ten years from now. The play would have been included in the
present edition if space had allowed.</p>

<p>When I came to a consideration of the modern section, there
were many omissions which had to be made, due very largely to
the fact that authors and owners of copyright were loath to forego
their rights. A collection of this kind should undoubtedly have
the name of James A. Herne represented in its contents, inasmuch
as none of Mr. Herne's plays have heretofore been published, and
two of his most distinctive dramas in original manuscript, "Margaret
Fleming" and "Griffith Davenport," have been totally destroyed
by fire. But representatives of Mr. Herne's family have
declined, at the present time, to allow his plays to be published.
This is to be regretted, inasmuch as nearly all of the most prominent
American playwrights are represented, either in the publication
of isolated plays or in definitive editions. I should have
liked to end this collection with the inclusion of Mr. Eugene
Walter's "The Easiest Way;" at the present time, that play,
which was once issued in an edition privately printed, is to be
found in the <i>Drama League Series</i> of plays.</p>

<p>From the standpoint of non-copyright material, two interesting
conditions have been revealed through investigation. The first
published play, in America, was "Androboros," by Governor
Robert Hunter, written in collaboration with Chief Justice Lewis
Morris.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Only one copy of that play is in existence, owned by
Mr. H. E. Huntington, of New York, having formerly been
a valued possession in the library of the Duke of Devonshire; and
having descended from the private ownership of David Garrick
and John Kemble, the English actors. Naturally, the private
collector is loath, in view of the rarity of his edition, to allow it,
at present, to be reprinted.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The title-page of "Androboros" reads: "Androboros"/ A/Bographical [<i>Sic.</i>]
Farce/In Three Acts, Viz./The Senate,/The Consistory,/and/The Apotheosis./
By Governour Hunter./Printed at Moropolis since 1st August, 1714. [Taken
from Huntington Copy. Moropolis means Fool's Town.]</p></div>

<p>Some scholars, however, point to "Les Muses de la Nouvelle-France,"
printed in Paris in 1609, where the third piece is "Le<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
Th&eacute;&acirc;tre de Neptune en la Nouvelle-France." According to Marc
Lescarbot, this was "repr&eacute;sent&eacute;e sur les flots du Port-Royal le
quatorzi&egrave;me de Novembre, mille six cens six, au retour de Sieur
de Poutrincourt du pais des Armouchiquois." This may be
regarded as example of the first play written and acted on North
American soil, it, however, being in French, and not given within
what is now the United States, but rather at Port Royal, in
Acadia. (See two interesting letters, 1<span style="vertical-align:super;">o</span> W. J. Neidig, <i>Nation</i>,
88:86, January 28, 1909; 2<span style="vertical-align:super;">o</span> Philip Alexander Bruce, <i>Nation</i>,
88:136, February 11, 1909.)</p>

<p>It was my further desire, as an example of college playwriting,
to include the text of Barnabas Bidwell's "The Mercenary
Match," written at Yale, and played by the students of Yale.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
Only one copy of that play is, thus far, known to be in existence,
owned by Mr. Evert Jansen Wendell, and its inclusion in the
present collection is debarred for the same reason.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> The/Mercenary Match,/A Tragedy./By Barna Bidwell./New Haven:/Printed
by Meigs, Bowen and Dana,/In Chapel-Street./(1785.)</p></div>

<p>Were this collection&mdash;Representative Plays by American
Dramatists&mdash;encyclopedic in its scope, rather than a suggestive
arrangement of a limited number of plays for the purpose of illustrating
certain phases of playwriting in American theatrical history,
it would have been necessary for the editor to intersperse,
here and there, between the plays, certain minor forms of dramatic
writing, characteristic of the work done in this country.
For example, plays and dialogues written at colleges at a period
ante-dating 1800, and likewise ante-dating the Revolution, are a
distinctive development in themselves, and would form an interesting
contrast with the work being done at the colleges since the
beginning of the present so-called dramatic renaissance (1917).
These dialogues, in their proper place, will be dealt with in the introductions
to a few of the plays. But it is well to indicate here
that such illustrations of very definite forms of dramatic expression
have been omitted.</p>

<p>In all cases the texts used have been carefully collated with
the first editions of the published dramas and, wherever possible,
the original casts have been given with the Dramatis Person&aelig;.
Interest in American drama consists very largely in the elements
of comparison and contrast which certain definite dramas suggest.
Even if there is no manuscript of "Metamora" extant,
there is sufficient data relating to the character of <i>Metamora</i> to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
contrast the play with Robert Rogers's "Ponteach." Even
though Mrs. Warren's "The Group" might be ruled out as an
acting drama, none the less is it definitely reflective of the
revolutionary temper of Revolutionary times. A comparison of other
types of plays will be made as they occur in the course of the three
volumes. I emphasize the point here, because I wish to suggest
that such a collection as this offers infinite possibilities in the
study of the historical, social, and economic evolution of America.</p>

<p>Most of these plays have been revived. There will be noted,
later, performances of "The Prince of Parthia," of "The Contrast,"
of Dunlap's "Andr&eacute;," and of Mrs. Mowatt's "Fashion," according
to our modern methods of acting. These plays may often seem
verbose and lacking in continuous development and interest.
This would lead us to believe that possibly the early actor had
means at his disposal of overcoming these defects by a method of
dramatic technique unknown to the present player. In reading
these dramas, one must be able to bear in mind the differences
which exist between the theatre of to-day and the theatre of yesterday,
between the tradition of the actor of to-day and of the
actor of yesterday. The technique, for example, in the characterization
of <i>Jonathan</i>, and in the characterization of <i>Solon
Shingle</i>, is different from the technique which characterizes the
work of Clyde Fitch or which is to be found in David Belasco's
"Peter Grimm." In other words, in such a collection, one asks, not
the judgment of the highest literary standards, but the judgment
of an historical appreciation of the changes in dramatic taste.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>This, the first volume of "Representative Plays by American
Dramatists," contains dramas which measure the tastes and inclinations
of Colonial and Revolutionary life. In the proper understanding
of their atmosphere, it is necessary to know something
of the general spirit of the theatre of the period; to measure
the conditions, customs, and social peculiarities of the provincial
actors and audiences. For that reason, it would be well for the
general reader beforehand to obtain a bird's-eye view of the
history of the American theatre&mdash;a view which will comprise
some consideration of the first playhouse in this country, of the
conditions which confronted Hallam, Henry, and Douglass, the
first actors to be at the head of what, in Williamsburg, Virginia,
was known as the Virginia Comedians, and in New York and
Philadelphia, as the American Company.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>No more fascinating study could be imagined than following
the trials and tribulations of the actors in America at this early
day, who, as soon as they reached Philadelphia, or as soon as they
attempted to invade Boston, were confronted by the Puritanical
and sectarian prejudices, against which the early history of the
American theatre had to struggle. The personalities of the
Hallams, of Douglass and Hodgkinson, are picturesque and worth
while tracing in all aspects of their Thespian careers in the
Colonies. So, too, the persons of Thomas Wignell, the Comedian,
and of Mrs. Merry, are of especial interest. Wignell, at the John
Street Theatre, in New York, and at the Southwark Theatre, in
Philadelphia, was wont to amuse George Washington, who, on
careful examination of his Journals and expense accounts, looms
up as the one big theatre-goer of the time.</p>

<p>The reader who follows the effect open hostility with England
had upon the American theatre, will find most interesting material
relating to the dramatic activities of the soldiers under the
leadership of Generals Burgoyne and Howe. In fact, no account
of dramatic writings in this country can ignore the fact that General
Burgoyne, apart from the farce which incited Mrs. Mercy
Warren, was himself a serious dramatist, who took his work seriously,
and whose dramas may be obtained at any large reference
library. The Red-Coats, as actors, amused their Tory public
with such plays as "Tamerlane," "The Busybody," and "Zara;"
and when they invaded the Southwark Theatre, around 1777,
Major Andr&eacute;, the presiding genius of the English soldier-actors,
turned to good account his ability as a scene-painter, and painted
a backdrop which was preserved in Philadelphia until 1821, when
it was destroyed by fire. We have, however, a description of the
scene, taken from Durang's "History of the Philadelphia Stage."</p>

<p>"It was a landscape," he writes, "presenting a distant <i>champagne</i>
country, and a winding rivulet, extending from the front
of the picture to the extreme distance. In the foreground and
centre was a gentle cascade&mdash;the water exquisitely executed&mdash;overshadowed
by a group of majestic forest trees. The perspective
was excellently preserved; the foliage, verdure, and general
colouring artistically toned and glazed. It was a drop scene, and
Andr&eacute;'s name was inscribed on the back of it in large black letters."</p>

<p>The early American theatre was nothing more than the theatre
of England transplanted to a more provincial atmosphere. We
have a record of dramatic performances being given at Williams<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
and Mary College before the Royal Governor, in 1702, and, in
1736, the students were presenting Addison's "Cato." In 1714,
in Massachusetts, Chief Justice Samuel Sewall, famed for his
witchcraft injunctions, protested against acting in Boston, and
warned the people in this fashion: "Let not Christian Boston goe
beyond Heathen Rome in the practice of Shameful Vanities."</p>

<p>Evidently the actors who had appeared in New York from the
West Indies, in 1702, were, by an ill wind, blown into the sharp-prejudiced
atmosphere of New England. Some authorities are
inclined to believe that Thomas Kean's appearance on March 5,
1750, in New York, when, as noted by the <i>Weekly Postboy</i>, he
gave a performance of "Richard III," with permission of Governor
Clinton, really begins the history of legitimate theatrical
performances in America. This, however, is not historically accurate,
for, in South Carolina, it is noted that the first dramatic
production occurred in 1734 or 1735, January 18th, although the
first Charleston theatre was afterwards erected in 1773, the third
regular theatre to be established in the Colonies. (See <i>The
Nation</i>, 99:278-279; Yates Snowden, "South Carolina Plays and
Playwrights," <i>The Carolinian</i>, November, 1909.)</p>

<p>The disputed point as to the first theatre in America has also
been very thoroughly discussed by Judge Charles P. Daly in his
brochure, "The First Theatre in America." (Dunlap Society,
New Series, No. 1, 1896.)</p>

<p>In 1755, the Reverend Samuel Davies, whose eloquence made
him quite as much an actor as a divine, complained of conditions
in Virginia, declaring that plays and romances were more read
than "the history of the Blessed Jesus."</p>

<p>The real narrative of Colonial acting, however, begins with
William Hallam's appearance in Williamsburg in "The Merchant
of Venice," on September 5, 1752; thereafter, as is so excellently
traced in Seilhamer, the American Theatre, with its different
itinerant companies, began to flourish.</p>

<p>The theatre was such a recreation to the Colonial people that,
in many ways, it figured as the one source of official entertainment;
especially on occasions when the Royal Governor had to
show hospitality to visiting people. For example, the <i>Maryland
Gazette</i> for November 17, 1752, declares that "The Emperor of
the Cherokee nation, with his Empress and their son, the young
Prince, attended by several of his warriors and Great Men, and
their Ladies, were received at the Palace by his Honour the Gov<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>ernor,
attended by such of the Council as were in Town on Thursday,
the 9th instant, with all the Marks of Courtesy and Friendship,
and were that Evening entertained at the Theatre with the
Play (the Tragedy of 'Othello'), and a Pantomime Performance
which gave them great surprise, as did the fighting with naked
swords on the Stage, which occasioned the Empress to order
some about her to go and prevent them killing one another."</p>

<p>The spirit of the theatre-going at this period has been excellently
suggested by John Esten Cook in his novel, "The Virginia
Comedians," but the reader who will consult rare files of Colonial
newspapers will find therein many advertisements which will
throw light on some of the social details of the theatre. It is
enough here to suggest that, in the reading of the different plays
here offered, some consideration be paid to the general theatrical
atmosphere which created and fostered them.</p>

<p>In several of the Introductions the editor has had occasion to
mention the exercises and dialogues and plays given in the colleges
before the Revolution. These were the distinctive forms
which time and occasion created; otherwise the early American
dramatist framed his pieces in imitation of English and German
tradition. However, as soon as the national period began, another
interesting dramatic experiment was put into effect. This
has been noted by W. W. Clapp, in his chapter written for Justin
Winsor's "Commemorative History of Boston." He says:</p>

<p>"[It was] the custom in the earlier days of the theatre to signalize
passing events by such appropriate notice as the resources of
the stage would permit."</p>

<p>In other words, the event called forth from the Manager, because
of commercial possibilities, certain spectacular scenes to attract
the patriotic notice of the people. Manager Hodgkinson,
on September 20, 1797, celebrated the launching of the frigate
<i>Constitution</i>.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> On January 8, 1800, at the New York Theatre, an
"Ode on the Death of General Washington" was recited by Mr.
Hodgkinson, written by Samuel Low. It is interesting here to
note likewise that Royall Tyler pronounced a Eulogy on Washington
at Bennington, Vermont, on February 22, 1800.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> Dunlap, himself atune to the hour, wrote "Yankee Chronology; or, Huzza
for the Constitution"&mdash;"a musical Interlude, in One Act, to which are added, The
Patriotic Songs of the Freedom of the Seas, and Yankee Tars," produced at the
Park Theatre, New York, 1812. Dunlap wrote many pieces of like character.</p></div>

<p>A patriotic effusion, celebrating the capture of the British
frigate <i>Guerri&egrave;re</i>, was produced on October 2, 1812. In 1813, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
commemorate the victory of Perry, a piece was mounted, entitled,
"Heroes of the Lake; or, the Glorious Tenth of September."
Another piece, equally as suggestive in its title, was
"The Sailor's Return; or, Constitution Safe in Port."</p>

<p>When the Marquis de Lafayette visited the United States in
1825, and was taken to the theatre, the occasion was celebrated
by an appropriate "drop." In other words, the Manager, even in
those days, had the commercial instinct fully developed.</p>

<p>In the preparation of the present collection, the editor wishes
to thank those who have been generous in their advice and appreciation
of the work in hand. Being a pioneer effort, the original
research necessitated has been of an extensive character. I have
had, in order to verify my data, to correspond extensively, not
only with the members of the families of the different playwrights,
but with many historical societies and libraries. I have likewise
had the advantage of being able to consult with Dr. F. W. Atkinson,
of the Brooklyn Polytechnic, whose collection of American
Drama is probably one of the richest in the country, and
with Professor Brander Matthews, whose interest in all drama
makes the historian continually in his debt. Certain information
concerning Royall Tyler has been furnished me by members of
the Tyler family, including Mrs. E. L. Pratt, of Boston. In their
proper places, when the plays occur, certain credits and references
will be found, but it is a pleasure for me here to thank Mr. Percy
Mackaye, Mr. David Belasco, Mr. Langdon Mitchell, Mr.
Augustus Thomas, the Clyde Fitch Estate, and the Bronson Howard
Estate, for their generous co&ouml;peration in bringing the present
collection to a successful issue. The privilege is also mine to
thank Mr. L. Nelson Nichols, of the Americana Division, and
Mr. Victor H. Paltsits, in charge of the Manuscript Division, of
the New York Public Library, together with other officials of that
Library, of Columbia University, and of the Library Company of
Philadelphia, and Miss Z. K. Macdonald, for their unfailing
courtesy and untiring efforts in my behalf.</p>

<p>In order to preserve uniformity of style throughout the text of
the plays certain modifications in punctuation and spelling have
been adopted.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
